      answer: "Cancer involves the dysregulation of cell cycle control mechanisms, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation. Key pathways include the p53 tumor suppressor pathway, which acts as the 'guardian of the genome' by detecting DNA damage and triggering cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway promotes cell survival and growth, while its dysregulation contributes to oncogenesis. DNA damage response mechanisms, including homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining, are crucial for maintaining genomic stability. Oncogenes like MYC and RAS, when mutated or overexpressed, drive malignant transformation through altered growth signaling cascades. Recent research focuses on targeted therapies, immunotherapy approaches, and precision medicine strategies that exploit specific molecular vulnerabilities in cancer cells.",
      confidence: 0.89
    },
    'gene': {
      answer: "Gene regulation involves complex molecular mechanisms including transcriptional control through promoters, enhancers, and silencers that determine when and where genes are expressed. Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and histone modifications create heritable changes in gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. Post-transcriptional regulation occurs through microRNAs, alternative splicing, and RNA-binding proteins that control mRNA stability and translation. Chromatin remodeling complexes dynamically alter DNA accessibility, while transcription factors bind specific sequences to activate or repress gene expression. Understanding these multilayered regulatory networks is crucial for developing gene therapies, epigenetic drugs, and personalized medicine approaches that target specific regulatory elements.",
      confidence: 0.87
    },
    'protein': {
      answer: "Protein folding follows thermodynamic principles where the native state represents the lowest free energy conformation, guided by hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds, and disulfide bridges. Molecular chaperones like HSP70, HSP90, and the GroEL/GroES system assist in proper folding by preventing aggregation and providing folding chambers. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated when misfolded proteins accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum. Misfolded proteins are targeted for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system or autophagy pathways. Protein aggregation is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's (amyloid plaques), Parkinson's (α-synuclein), and Huntington's disease (huntingtin). Current research focuses on chaperone therapy, small molecule folding enhancers, and targeted protein degradation strategies.",

    'dna': {
      answer: "DNA repair mechanisms are essential for maintaining genomic stability and preventing mutations that can lead to cancer and genetic diseases. Base excision repair (BER) corrects single base modifications like oxidative damage through glycosylases and DNA polymerase β. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) removes bulky DNA lesions including UV-induced pyrimidine dimers. Mismatch repair (MMR) corrects replication errors through MutS and MutL protein complexes. Double-strand break repair occurs via homologous recombination, which requires BRCA1/2 proteins and is highly accurate, or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which is faster but error-prone. Defects in these systems, particularly in genes like BRCA1/2, lead to increased mutation rates and cancer predisposition, forming the basis for synthetic lethality approaches in cancer therapy.",
